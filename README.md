# My classifier for MNIST
Credit is given to [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-neural-network/)
and Stanford CS231n.
## Backstory
This comes from a while back, specifically last summer,
when I was first getting my feet wet in the field of neural networks.
I was trying to create a classifier for MNIST.
I spent weeks trying, but ended up with nothing.
Now that I'm doing the homework for Stanford CS231n and that I know
a thing a two more about neural networks, I'm getting revenge
on last summer.

The backend for this GUI is a 6-layer deep neural network that achieves
a validation accuracy of 97.47% on the MNIST test set. (It was not
introduced to these examples during training.) It was trained using code
that was previously used to do a homework assignment from Stanford CS231n.

To run this, go to your terminal and run
```
python -m classifier.py.
```
