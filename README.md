Credit is given to [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-neural-network/)
and Stanford CS231n.
Also, big thanks for `hsjeong5`,
who made a python script for loading the MNIST dataset.
`tf.keras` isn't supported on Python 3.13, and the script (`load_mnist.py`)
was a big help in loading the dataset.

## Usage

To run this, go to your terminal and run

```bash
ipython classifier.py
```
